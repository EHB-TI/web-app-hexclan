# Goal
*describe how this web app will (evantually) earn money or make the world a better place*

We want to optimise and digitize the way parents approach a children's day care centre from the moment their child is born until the child goes to kindergarten.
For that, we foresee a website with some static webpages, but also a web page that allows the parents to raise questions, ask supplementary information on the website.
That information will have to be sent securely. The personal data entered on the form will have to be kept securely following GDPR requirements.

# Acceptance criteria
*how do we know that the goals have been reached?*

The website is securely hosted on a cloud server.
Messages can be sent by visitors of the website. It should not be possible to send hundreds of messages at once (email bomb).
The personal data entered should be stored on a contacts database to be able to respond to the message. 

# Threat model
*describe your threat model. One or more architectural diagram expected. Also a list of the principal threats and what you will do about them*
# Deployment
*minimally, this section contains a public URL of the app. A description of how your software is deployed is a bonus. Do you do this manually, or did you manage to automate? Have you taken into account the security of your deployment process?*
# *you may want further sections*
*especially if the use of your application is not self-evident*
