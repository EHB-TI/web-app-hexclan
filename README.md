# Goal
*describe how this web app will (evantually) earn money or make the world a better place*

- Idea1
We want to optimise and digitize the way parents approach a children's day care centre from the moment their child is born until the child goes to kindergarten.
For that, we foresee a website with some static webpages, but also a web page that allows the parents to raise questions, ask supplementary information on the website.
That information will have to be sent securely. The personal data entered on the form will have to be kept securely following GDPR requirements.

- Idea2
Imagine an association, chiro, scouts or petanque club that wishes to organise a fundraising event such as a BBQ or a party. Usually, we work with meal and drinking vouchers sold at the cash register at the entrance. We want to get rid of all the hassles due to working with cash money and the potential fraud.
Let's digitize this burdensome process during these fun events. 

# Acceptance criteria
*how do we know that the goals have been reached?*

- Idea1
The website is securely hosted on a cloud server.
Messages can be sent by visitors of the website. It should not be possible to send hundreds of messages at once (email bomb).
The personal data entered should be stored on a contacts database to be able to respond to the message.

- Idea2
The administrator can enter the name of the event, bank account and what the customer wishes to purchase (simple catalogue with 3 or 4 options).
Example: 
  Name event: Chiro fuif
  Bank account (beneficiary): BE15 0016 7783 1431
  Purchase: drankkaart van 10 bonnetjes
That generates a QR code that can be read by Payconiq.
